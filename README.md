# Niantic Wayfarer Anti-Home
This Tampermonkey plugin helps users avoid setting a Home location in Niantic Wayfarer and renders an approximation of a showcase.

No attempt is made to pretend this is normal activity. If Niantic wants to check whether you're using this, they 100% can. All usage is at your own risk.

Assuming you already have Tampermonkey, [click here](https://github.com/NvlblNm/wayfarer-onboarding-showcase/raw/main/onboarding-showcase.user.js) to install.
